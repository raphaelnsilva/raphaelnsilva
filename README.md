**Hello there! 👋🏼, I'm Raphael, a software developer, living in Brazil. Loving love what I do. Actualy I've been making some JavaScript projects and it's being good to expand my knowledge. Occasionally I tend to read documentation in English which also helps me a lot. In my free time, you can find me on the basketball court or vibing to some musics to keep the focus**
